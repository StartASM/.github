## StartASM
# Overview
StartASM is a personal project that aims to create a simple, beginner-friendly assembly language. Its main goals are:
- Create a readable, English-like syntax with greater verbosity and clarity
- Abstract many complicated facets of assembly programming to reduce complexity
- Introduce assembly programming concepts in a straightforward, simplified manner

StartASM was created after personally struggling to learn x86 as a complete newcomer to assembly programming. I want this project to be a simpler, more intuitive introduction to assembly concepts that could be an effective stepping stone toward learning industry-standard languages. It is also a personal exercise in self-learning and is my first time engaging with many of these concepts myself.

# Components
Right now, StartASM consists of two main components, both of which are under work. `StartASM` is the main directory for the custom LLVM-based compiler - written in C++ - and forms the project's backbone. Additionally, another project called `Ignition` is in the works, which hopes to arm the language with a robust interpreter and step-through debugger.

# License and Collaboration
Everything - now and in the future - is or will be licensed under MIT. Feel free to use or modify any of the code as you see fit. Feel free to take a look at the components of any of the repositories! If you're interested, contributions are also welcome :)
